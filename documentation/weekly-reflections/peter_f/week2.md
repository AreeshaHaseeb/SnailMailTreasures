## Week 2 reflections

We had two meetings this week. On Monday we practiced doing pull requests in GitHub and for those that couldn't be there on Monday we had a quick refresher on Thursday. We added some tasks to the task board and everyone has assigned themselves to tasks which is good to see. It has been a somewhat slow start so I hope we can pick up the pace and have a finished product before the due date so that we have some time for polishing work.

I continued working on the database and I have managed to make it work for the most part. What remains is to get it to a state where the other developers can start using it for their components on the front-end. I am probably going to need a hand with that and Simon mentioned that he had some experience with MongoDB so I will ask him.
