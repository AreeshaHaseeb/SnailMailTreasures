## Week 1 reflections

We had two meetings this week, as planned, which is good. On Monday's meeting we set out a task for everyone to by Thursday
offer at least one suggestion for the layout and color scheme of the page and I would have liked to see a bit more response
on that. The repo was set up in a correct and timely manner which is a good first step for this project.

So far I think communication is working well and I think everyone is in agreement that the structured and organized
approach will lead to a good pace of development.

I took on the task of fixing the database but was not able to finish it by Thursday. I would have liked to get it done on
time, but I also do not want to rush it and make unnecessary mistakes.
