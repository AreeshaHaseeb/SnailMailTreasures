## Week 3 Reflections

We had our meeting with Michiel this week and it was clear that our project is falling behind. We have to pick up the pace
and I wrote a long message to the group expressing the need for us to put in the work to get us back on track. Based on suggestion
from Michiel I will take a step back from coding this coming week. That doesn't mean I will not be doing any coding but I will focus
more on delegating tasks where necessary and checking up on the dev team to see where I need to lend to hand so that we can deliver 
a viable product.

I have mixed feelings about taking a step back from coding. This is a course in coding, I of course want to improve my coding a
bilities by working on it, but at the same time I did accept the role of Scrum Master and that comes with some added responsibility.

On a more positive note I managed to fix most of the issues with the CRUD routes and updated the naming convention to make it more
clear what the different elements in the code represent.
