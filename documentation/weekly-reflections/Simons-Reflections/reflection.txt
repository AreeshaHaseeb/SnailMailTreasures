# Simon's Weekly Reflection

First week was pritty slow, we just set up the project and started to plan the app.
we picked a proejct based on what we know we can complete either way.

lets hope the group holds together.

personaly i set up the porject and the git repo along with the github thing that lets us use github
to track whats done and not.
